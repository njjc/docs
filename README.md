The Nonprofit Starter Pack (NPSP) is an application that integrates directly with Salesforce to help nonprofits and higher ed institutions use Salesforce more effectively. The NPSP is an open-source project that thrives on the generosity of its developer community.

This document outlines everything you need to know to start contributing code to the NPSP. Weâ€™ll show you how to set up your development environment, how to develop in the NPSP code base, and how to submit changes to the Salesforce Foundation for review.

# GIT and Initial Setup

1.  [Set up git and github](Github.md)
    - Create a github account
    - Fork the NPSP repository
    - Set up SSH access to github
    - Copy your forked repository to your local machine
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/Cumulus.git
        ```
    - Create a build.properties file at the root of your git repository, with these lines:
        ```
        sf.serverurl=https://login.salesforce.com
        sf.username=your_de_login@salesforce.com
        sf.password=passwordAndSecurityToken
        ```
2.  [Set up Salesforce Developer Edition](Developer-Edition-Salesforce-Instance.md)
    - Create a new Salesforce Developer Edition organization
    - Create the Cumulus Unmanaged Package
        - Each time new metadata is added through the UI or created via your IDE, it must be added to the unmanaged package.
        - Note: ANT scripts are not currently configured to handle all metadata types (weblinks and others are not yet supported)
    - Use ant build target to set up your DE org
        ```sh
        ant deployCI
        ```
3. Set up an IDE
    - [Force.com IDE](Force.com-IDE-Setup.md)
    - [Alternate IDEs](Alternate-IDEs.md) (MavensMate, et al.)
4. [Do the work!](Do-the-Work.md)
    - [ApexDoc](http://developer.salesforcefoundation.org/Cumulus/)
    - Coding conventions
    - TDTM
    - Error Handling
    - Ant build targets
        - To update metadata added through the UI and in the Cumulus unmanaged package:
            ```sh
            ant retrievePackagedToSrc
            ant updatePackageXml
            ```
        - After a pull, to update your dev environment with any changes pulled down from github:
            ```
            ant updatePackageXml
            ant deployWithoutTest
            ```
5. [Submit the work](Submit-Your-Feature.md)
